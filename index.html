          On the path of becoming a programmer with Le Wagon. Currently learning the concepts of object oriented programming. The last three weeks have been spent learning Ruby, followed by SQL, relational databases, and now HTML and CSS.

    <h2>Ruby</h2>
      <p class="text-center">Learning the concepts of Ruby has been a great experience. Post-bootcamp I plan to go deeper into the rural areas of Bali. All I need is a place to stay with a good internet connection, together with passing Bakso bikes. During that time I intend to self-educate and practice Ruby to cement my understanding.

    <h2>SQL</h2>
      <p class="text-center">The module on SQL was fun, and gave me an introduction to the power of SQL queries. I look forward to becoming even more proficient in SQL and managing databases.

    <h2>Indonesian</h2>
    <p class="text-center">In my spare time these days, which is few and far between, I enjoy learning the Indonesian language on the Babbel app. I will continue to learn in order to become capable in the language.</p>
